# A directive changes the way Ansible manages a task. 
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html#selecting-a-strategy
#
# An Ansible directive is similar to a programming directive. 
# A programming directive instructs a compiler or interpreter to do something special.
# An ansible directive tells the ansible engine to do something special.
