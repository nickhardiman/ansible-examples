# A fact is a variable containing data about a host. 
# Facts are added to the current host's dictionary.
# They are not visible to any other hosts. 
# The first play sets some facts for host1.
# The second play tries to view one of these facts and fails.
#
# If you want to copy a variable from one host to another, check out var-scope.yml
# If you want to see all the facts ansible collects about a host, see play-gather_facts.yml
