# A static inventory file can contain data in two formats, YAML and INI. 
# Plugins help Ansible decipher data in the file.
#
# * INI - Microsoft's .ini style - the default and by far the most common
# * YAML - same thing but with dictionaries, lists and indentation
#
# inventory file fails
# There is no plugin for JSON or TOML. 
# If you try this, you will see errors about ansible's plugins failing to understand what's going on.
# ansible-playbook -i inventory-static-inventory.json inventory-static.yml
# ansible-playbook -i inventory-static-inventory.toml inventory-static.yml
#
# convert from one format to another 
# from INI to YAML
ansible-inventory --inventory inventory-static-inventory.ini --list --yaml
# from INI to TOML
# requires optional Python library "toml"
ansible-inventory --inventory inventory-static-inventory.ini --list --toml
# from YAML to JSON
# ansible-inventory --inventory inventory-static-inventory.yml --list

# mock hosts
# This playbook runs on host1, host2, host3 and host4. 
# Or at least it looks like it does -  we don't really have many machines.
# Connection trickery points all host names to localhost.
# Have a look at the inventory to see the "ansible_connection: local" line.
# For more information, see "Connecting to hosts: behavioral inventory parameters".
